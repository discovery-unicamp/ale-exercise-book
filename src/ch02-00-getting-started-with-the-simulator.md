# Getting Started with the Simulator

This chapter contains a set of exercises to help students getting started with the ALE simulator.

All exercises in this chapter assume the student is already familiar with compiling, assembling, and linking code for RISC-V processors. These concepts are covered by Section 3 of the ALE manual and the exercises in the previous chapter.
