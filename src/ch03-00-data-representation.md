# Data Representation on Modern Computers

This chapter contains a set of exercises to help students learn how data is represented on modern computers, including how numbers and text are represented, how data is organized on the main memory, and how computer instructions are encoded.
Students are expected to read chapter 2 of the textbook ([An Introduction to Assembly Programming with RISC-V](https://riscv-programming.org/book.html)).
